# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Docker Compose stack that runs a Soccerverse Game State Provider (GSP) plus its supporting services (Xaya X, MariaDB archival store, Redis cache, Graph Protocol indexing pipeline, datacentre updater + API) against a remote EVM RPC endpoint, all behind an Nginx reverse proxy on `localhost:8100`. Designed for Portainer-from-git deploys with operator-supplied pre-built images for the heavyweight services.

The legacy local Anvil fork and the Python helper RPC server are no longer wired into compose; the `basechain/` and `helper/` directories remain in the tree but are inert. `/chain` is now a pass-through to a real RPC endpoint.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start the full environment (requires .env populated — see Configuration)
docker compose up -d

# Tear down (keeps volumes)
docker compose down

# Tear down + wipe all volumes (destructive — wipes mariadb_data, graph_postgres_data, etc.)
docker compose down --volumes

# Rebuild one of the locally-built helper services (nginx, mariadb, healthcheck_xayax)
docker compose build nginx
```

## Architecture

### Services (docker-compose.yml)

- **`nginx`** — reverse proxy, the only host-published service (port 8100). Renders `proxy.conf.template` via `envsubst`. Routes:
  - `/chain` → `${BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL}` (auth header injected, WebSocket-capable)
  - `/gsp` → `gsp:8600`
  - `/api` → `datacentre-api:8000`
- **`xayax`** — `xaya/xayax` (eth mode), connects via `http://nginx/chain`.
- **`gsp-init`** — one-shot Alpine. Seeds `${STORAGE_SQLITE_PATH}` into the `gspdata` volume and applies idempotent Soccerverse SQLite migrations.
- **`mariadb`** — built from `db-init/`. Creates `archival`, `datacentre`, `userconfig`, `lapsed_users`, `bigquery_local` databases on first start; imports `archival.sql` and `userconfig.sql`. Healthcheck `start_period` is 30 minutes for the slow archival import.
- **`gsp`** — `${GSP_IMAGE}` (Soccerverse GSP). Uses MariaDB `archival`, talks to `xayax`.
- **`redis`** — `redis:7-alpine`, used as cache by `datacentre-api`.
- **`graph-postgres`** — `postgres:14`, locale C, UTF8. Storage backend for `graph-node`.
- **`ipfs`** — `ipfs/kubo`, manifest store for `graph-node`.
- **`graph-node`** — `graphprotocol/graph-node`. Indexes `matic` via `http://nginx/chain`. Internal-only.
- **`subgraph-deploy`** — `${SUBGRAPH_DEPLOY_IMAGE}`, one-shot. For each of `./subgraphs/{stats,sv,democrit}`: skips if any ABI contains the `_DATACENTRE_STACK_PLACEHOLDER` marker (see `subgraphs/democrit/POPULATE_ABIS.md`); otherwise copies the subgraph to writable scratch, runs `npm install` + `graph codegen` + `graph build` + `graph create` + `graph deploy`, then queries `graph-postgres` for the resulting IPFS hash and writes it to `/shared/graph_hashes.env` in the `graph_hashes_shared` volume.
- **`datacentre-updater`** — `${DATACENTRE_UPDATER_IMAGE}`. Reads SQLite + MariaDB; writes MariaDB (`datacentre`, `bigquery_local`) and the shared `datadumps` volume. Compose entrypoint applies the `utf8mb4_0900_bin` → `utf8mb4_bin` collation patch at runtime via `sed -i db_manager.py` (also applied at build time inside the vendored `Dockerfile`, so the patch is no-op-safe if your image already includes it).
- **`datacentre-api`** — `${DATACENTRE_API_IMAGE}`. FastAPI behind Gunicorn. Entrypoint sources `/shared/graph_hashes.env` (auto-exported via `set -a`) before starting Python so `lookup_subgraph_schemas()` resolves locally-deployed subgraph hashes against `graph-postgres`.
- **`healthcheck_xayax`** — sidecar, checks `xayax:8000` reachable.

### Service dependency chain

```
ipfs, graph-postgres, redis, mariadb, nginx, xayax — all start independently
graph-node             ← depends on ipfs, graph-postgres healthy
subgraph-deploy        ← depends on graph-node healthy (one-shot)
healthcheck_xayax      ← checks xayax
gsp-init               ← one-shot
gsp                    ← gsp-init complete + healthcheck_xayax healthy + mariadb healthy
datacentre-updater     ← mariadb + gsp-init + subgraph-deploy
datacentre-api         ← mariadb + redis + graph-postgres + gsp-init + subgraph-deploy
```

### Sources

```
forked-evm-testing/
├── subgraphs/             bind-mounted into subgraph-deploy at runtime
│   ├── stats/             xaya-stats subgraph
│   ├── sv/                sv-subgraph
│   └── democrit/          democrit-sv subgraph (placeholder ABIs — see POPULATE_ABIS.md)
└── subgraph-deploy/       Dockerfile + deploy.sh for the one-shot deployer (built into ${SUBGRAPH_DEPLOY_IMAGE})
```

`datacentre-api` and `datacentre-updater` are NOT vendored in this repo. Their sources live in separate upstream repos at `C:\WorkFiles\datacentre_api` and `C:\WorkFiles\datacentre_updater`; build the `${DATACENTRE_API_IMAGE}` / `${DATACENTRE_UPDATER_IMAGE}` images directly from there (see "Building images" below). The `datacentre_updater` upstream Dockerfile must include the build-time `utf8mb4_0900_bin` → `utf8mb4_bin` sed patch on `db_manager.py`; if your image doesn't have it, the compose entrypoint applies it at runtime as a fallback.

`subgraphs/{stats,sv,democrit}/` ARE vendored because they're bind-mounted into `subgraph-deploy` at runtime (`graph codegen` + `graph build` run inside the container against these files). Re-sync from upstream (`C:\WorkFiles\stats-subgraph`, `C:\WorkFiles\subgraph`, `C:\WorkFiles\democrit-evm\subgraph`) is a manual `cp -r`.

### Internal networking

Services reference each other by Docker hostname (`http://nginx/chain`, `http://graph-node:8000/subgraphs/name/sv`, `mysql://...@mariadb:3306/...`, `redis://redis:6379`, `graph-postgres:5432`, `ipfs:5001`). Only `nginx` and (optionally) `mariadb` (host port `${MARIADB_PORT}`, default 3307) are reachable from the host.

### Boot timing

Cold boot from `docker compose up -d`:
- ~30s — graph-node ready
- ~1-2m — `subgraph-deploy` finishes and writes `graph_hashes.env`
- ~2-30m — `mariadb` healthy (first-boot import depends on dump size)
- ~2m+ after the above — `datacentre-api` starts; MariaDB+SQLite endpoints work fully
- hours-days — graph-node indexing catches up; subgraph-backed endpoints (`/leaderboards`, `/user_activity`, `/shop`, parts of `/market`) progressively populate

Indexing volume can be substantial — graph-node will issue many `eth_getLogs`/`eth_call` requests to `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL` during cold sync.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Required:

- `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL` — full RPC URL (used by both nginx and graph-node)
- `BLOCKCHAIN_AUTH_HEADER` — `Authorization` header value (empty if endpoint needs none)
- `ACCOUNTS_CONTRACT` — XayaAccounts address
- `GSP_IMAGE` — Soccerverse GSP image
- `DATACENTRE_API_IMAGE` — pre-built image for the API
- `DATACENTRE_UPDATER_IMAGE` — pre-built image for the updater
- `SUBGRAPH_DEPLOY_IMAGE` — pre-built image for the one-shot subgraph deployer

Optional:

- `GAME_ID` (default `sv`)
- `STORAGE_SQLITE_PATH`, `ARCHIVAL_SQL_PATH`, `USERCONFIG_SQL_PATH` — first-boot seed inputs
- `DEMOCRIT_ABI_PATH`, `VAULTMANAGER_ABI_PATH` — host paths to real democrit ABI JSONs (forge build artefacts). When unset, in-repo placeholders are used and `subgraph-deploy` skips democrit. See `subgraphs/democrit/POPULATE_ABIS.md`.
- `MARIADB_PORT` (default `3307`) — host-side port

All other configuration (Redis URL, Graph Postgres credentials, BigQuery local DB, dump folder paths, subgraph URLs, etc.) is hardcoded in `docker-compose.yml` because those are stack-internal Docker hostnames.

## Building images

Two of the three image sources live in separate upstream repos; one (`subgraph-deploy`) is in this repo.

```bash
# datacentre-api — built from the upstream repo (NOT vendored here)
cd /c/WorkFiles/datacentre_api
docker build -t YOUR_REGISTRY/datacentre-api:VERSION \
  -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker push YOUR_REGISTRY/datacentre-api:VERSION

# datacentre-updater — built from the upstream repo (NOT vendored here)
cd /c/WorkFiles/datacentre_updater
docker build -t YOUR_REGISTRY/datacentre-updater:VERSION \
  -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker push YOUR_REGISTRY/datacentre-updater:VERSION

# subgraph-deploy — built from this repo. Build context MUST be the repo
# root (not subgraph-deploy/) because the subgraph sources are baked into
# the image (so the stack works on Portainer agents that don't clone the
# repo to the host filesystem).
cd /c/WorkFiles/forked-evm-testing
docker build -f subgraph-deploy/Dockerfile -t YOUR_REGISTRY/subgraph-deploy:VERSION .
docker push YOUR_REGISTRY/subgraph-deploy:VERSION
```

When subgraph sources change (`subgraphs/{stats,sv,democrit}/`), rebuild and push the `subgraph-deploy` image — there is no longer a bind mount, so changes only take effect after a new image is pulled.

Then set the matching `*_IMAGE` env vars in `.env`. Re-running `docker compose up -d` pulls the new images.

## Operational notes

- **First start is slow.** `mariadb` archival import + graph-node indexing both take time. Healthcheck `start_period` for mariadb is 30 minutes; for graph-node it's just service-up (indexing happens in the background).
- **`gsp-init` schema migrations are idempotent** (`2>/dev/null || true`). Add new ALTERs in the same pattern.
- **`subgraph-deploy` is idempotent.** Re-running on unchanged sources is fast — graph-cli detects unchanged manifests. The deploy script overwrites `/shared/graph_hashes.env` each run.
- **Subgraph sources are baked into the image.** They are NOT bind-mounted from the host. This is intentional: Portainer agents in some configurations don't clone the git repo to the host, so bind mounts pointing at `./subgraphs/...` resolve to empty dirs (Docker silently auto-creates missing bind sources). To update subgraph sources, rebuild and push `${SUBGRAPH_DEPLOY_IMAGE}` per the "Building images" section.
- **democrit subgraph ships with placeholder ABIs baked in.** Real ABIs require `forge build` of the upstream `democrit-evm` repo. Operator supplies host paths via `DEMOCRIT_ABI_PATH` / `VAULTMANAGER_ABI_PATH`; deploy.sh copies them over the placeholders at runtime. When unset, the placeholders stay in place and democrit is skipped (logs a warning); the stack still boots cleanly. See `subgraphs/democrit/POPULATE_ABIS.md`.
- **Collation patch:** `datacentre-updater`'s compose entrypoint runs `sed -i 's/utf8mb4_0900_bin/utf8mb4_bin/g' db_manager.py` at every container start (idempotent — once patched, sed matches nothing). The vendored `datacentre_updater/docker/Dockerfile` also applies the patch at build time, so anyone re-rolling the image from source gets it baked in.
- **Editing `proxy.conf.template`:** the file is rendered through `envsubst` with the explicit allowlist `$BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL $BLOCKCHAIN_AUTH_HEADER` in `nginx/entrypoint.sh`. Any new env var referenced in the template must be added to that allowlist.
- **Stack memory footprint:** ~6-8 GB RAM during indexing. Postgres + graph-node + mariadb dominate.
- **Legacy directories**: `basechain/` and `helper/` remain in the tree from the original Anvil-fork design but are no longer wired into compose. Treat as inert unless re-introduced.
